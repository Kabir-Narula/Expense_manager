## Project Description
Our group will be developing a budgeting website. This website will feature tools that allow users to track how much money they are making or losing per month. The main tools will include: a dashboard that displays their monthly loss or savings with options for creating or adding expenses, a page for adding expenses, and a page for adding income. 

### Dashboard
The dashboard will be on the home page for the user. Users will be able to view how much money they are losing or saving per month. They will also have options for creating expenses or income for a designated month.

### Expenses
Users will be able to add a title, description, and cost associated with the expense. A button for adding expenses will be available from the dashboard which will redirect them to this page. 

### Income
Users will be able to add a title, description, and cost associated with the expense. A button for adding income will be availale from the dashboard which will redirect them to this page. 

## Tech Stack 
### Backend
The backend will run on Node.js and will use an Express.js network to process HTTP requests. All of the users data will be stored in MongoDB Atlas. 

### Frontend
The Frontend will be made using Reat-Bootstrap. 

### Developing tools. 
The website will be developed using Visual Studio Code with a number of npm installations. We will use Postman and THunder Client to test HTTP requests.
